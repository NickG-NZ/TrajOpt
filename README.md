# TrajOpt
**Trajectory Optimization Tools for Robotics**

MILQR non-linear traj-opt with explicit handling of topography of SO(3) group (3D Rotations)
Highly efficient with active-set method (projected-Newton) for handling input constraints
(ILQR is DDP with first order expansion of dynamics)

TODO: NLP
Generic tools for direct trajectory optimzation interfacing
various NLP (non-linear programming) solvers.
Include both collocation and pseudo-spectral methods.
