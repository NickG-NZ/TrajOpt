# TrajOpt
**Trajectory Optimization Tools for Robotics**

**MILQR Algorithm** - Non-linear trajectory-optimisation with explicit handling of topology of SO(3) group (3D Rotations)
Highly efficient with active-set method (projected-Newton) for handling input constraints
(ILQR is DDP with first order expansion of dynamics)

TODO: NLP
Tools for direct trajectory optimzation (colocation, multi-shooting and pseudo-spectral) interfacing
various NLP (non-linear programming) solvers.
